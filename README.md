# Reconstructing Childrenâ€™s Faces from Cropped Lip and Nose Images: A Large Mask Inpainting Approach for Privacy-Conscious Cleft Data

The pipeline for Synthetically generating whole faces of children with Cleft condition is made of two submodules, Custom Keypoint Prediction Module and GAN-Inpainting Model. 

Pretrained weights for LaFIn GAN-Inpainting module can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SGH451X_jFYbVu0g3jXajfSwn3egB9cW?usp=drive_link)

Young Labelled Faces in Wild (YFLW) dataset for training Inpainting model for children can be obtained at [project website](https://github.com/JessyFrish/YLFW_Links)

iBug-300 Dataset link for training Facial keypoint model can be obtained in [project website](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/)

### Pre-op Cleft15 Dataset
The images of pre-op cleft images are collected from flicker and included [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10XZzyUoEVb07x2NpRXMz9eGq_hp-_jXD?usp=sharing) along with references.
